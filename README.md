# Website Meta
Collection of meta tags and image assets to ease implementation of meta data on Live Nation websites. 

This repo includes two sets of icons. One utilizes the version of the Live Nation logo that has the Fanman, the other set does not have the Fanman.

## Icon Exporter
These icons are produced using a modified version of this [Sketch Favicon Exporter](https://github.com/frederik-jacques/sketch-favicon-exporter-template).

## File Size Optimization
If you need to generate new icons, make sure to run the `PNG`s through [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) to reduce their file size, and minimize the `SVG` file with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).

## ICO Generation
The one file that Sketch is not able to export is the `favicon.ico`. To create that, upload the `32x32` `PNG` to [Favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc).
